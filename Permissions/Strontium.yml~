# System is no longer used, but may become used in the future
# Copies is for multiple-world support
#   Put the name of the world you wish for it to be a clone of, otherwise leave it empty.
#   Does not work for the default world.
#  Example: copies: Derp    -  This will clone the permissions of the world Derp
plugin:
    permissions:
        system: default
        copies: 

# Groups can contain inheritance.
#   To make a group inherit the permissions from another
#   group simply place the groups name in the "inheritance:" like so:
#
#   Example:
#       inheritance:
#           - Default
##
#   All permissions including the asterisks must be placed in single quotes.
#   like so:
#
#       - 'general.spawn'
#
#   Otherwise errors will happen!
##
#   Globalized Permission settings:
#
#       If a permission contains periods (.) you can denote a globalized parameter:
#
#           - 'general.*'
#
#       This will allow you to use all general commands.
#
##
#   Single Asterisk denotes all commands:
#
#       - '*'
##
#   To exempt a node use the - prefix like so:
#       - '-general.time'
##
groups:
    Default:
        default: true
        info:
            prefix: ''
            suffix: ''
            build: true
        inheritance:
        permissions:
            - 'foo.bar'
    Admins:
        default: false
        info:
            prefix: ''
            suffix: ''
            build: true
        inheritance:
            - Default
        permissions:
            - '*'
